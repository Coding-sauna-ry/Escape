# Escape - Shortest Path Algorithm

## Context
Open Google Map from your phone, find Direction from Platform 6 to Luupi
You should see the recommended shortest route by Google Map.

‚ùî How does Google Map recommend you this route

## Challenge
To pass this challenge, you need to demonstrate to the Judge the pathfinding algorithms of A* and Dijkstra in finding direction from Platform 6 to Luupi.

A [map](https://github.com/Coding-sauna-ry/Escape/blob/main/Escape-map.png) is ready for you. From the Start point, consider the nodes, implement A* & Dijkstra algorithms to reach the Destination. Explain them to the Judge.
